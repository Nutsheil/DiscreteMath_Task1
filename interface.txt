Diff "set_a" "set_b" "set_c"
writes to a set named "set_c" the result of subtraction from the set "set_a" set "set_b"
If the set "set_c" already exists, then it will be recreated

SymmDiff "set_a" "set_b" "set_c"
Writes to the set named "set_c" the result of the symmetric difference of the sets "set_a" and "set_b"
If the set "set_c" already exists, then it will be recreated
